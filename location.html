    <h3>Whitewater Play Park</h3>
      <p>Traditional whitewater parks (often referred to as “Kayak Parks” or “Whitewater Kayak Parks”) are created using simple modifications to a natural river. These typically take the form of dam modifications, designed to allow for safe raft and
        kayak passage as well as recreational boating.</p>

    <h3>River Surf Waves</h3>
      <p>Standing waves are stationary on the river, caused by a high volume of water constricted by flowing over a rock and creating a wave behind. Kayak river surfing can face up-stream and catch waves and have the feeling of traveling fast over
        water while not actually moving.</p>

        progression in your playboat style and opens the boating session up year round.</p>
